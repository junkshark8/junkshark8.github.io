                            After administering vaccinations to health care workers and
                            long-term care facility residents, Johnson
                            County health organizations will pivot to
                            the second phase of COVID-19 vaccinations on Feb. 1. </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            The second group, phase 1B, includes
                            individuals age 65 and older, Pre-K-12
                            school staff, and first responders, according to the Johnson County Public Health
                            website. Details about how and when people can get a vaccine have
                            not yet been released by the
                            Iowa Department of Public
                            Health, though public health
                            experts expect the vaccine
                            to be available at 1,700 doctor’s offices, health clinics,
                            and pharmacies in Iowa that
                            have signed up to vaccinate

                            Community Health Manager for Johnson County Public Health Sam Jarvis said Johnson County
                            Public Health and the state of Iowa allocate doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and
                            recruit vetted providers to work with.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Jarvis said most of the doses available
                            are now going to Johnson County hospitals to cover phase 1A of the COVID-19
                            vaccine, which included front-line health
                            care workers and long-term care facility
                            residents and staff.</p>

                        <p>
                            “We’re still trying to get as many people
                            vaccinated safely and quickly as possible,”
                            Jarvis said, “... but the role of public health is
                            really to make
                            sure that these
                            doses are going to
                            where they get
                            where they’re

                            Members of Iowa’s mostly Republican congressional
                            delegation say they want to continue to build on Trumpera policies in the new Biden-Harris administration while
                            moving past the former president’s divisive rhetoric.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Iowa’s Republican senators, in the majority for the last
                            four years, will now have to work with a Democratic Congress and presidential administration.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, both
                            named agriculture, tax cuts, and criminal justice reform as
                            areas they hope to find common ground with the Democratic majority. Both senators named the First Step Act, a
                            criminal-justice law signed by Trump in 2018, as a bipartisan piece of legislation they hope to build off of in the new
                            Congress.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Grassley sponsored the First Step Act, along with U.S.
                            Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Grassley said this bill was necessary in correcting some injustices brought forth by the
                            1994 crime bill.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            “At the time Durbin and I were working on that bill, we
                            were up against a majority of the Republican caucus being against what we tried to do, and if the president hadn’t
                            been for it, I wouldn’t have been able to overcome McConnell’s opposition to it,” Grassley said of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel, R-Ky. “And you know, in the
                            end, McConnell even voted for it and it passed 87 to 12.”</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            The First Step Act aimed to reduce prison populations,
                            reduce mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses, and expand rehabilitation efforts. Ernst said she is currently working with U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., on a bill
                            that would allow people convicted of minor drug offenses
                            greater opportunity for work.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            Ernst called it a “shame” that a lot of Trump-era policies
                            in these areas were lost in his divisive and politically incor-</p>

                            This comes as former President Trump
                            recently lessened international travel restrictions, lifting the ban on travelers from
                            Europe and Brazil entering the United States
                            on Jan. 18.</p>

                            Planning future travel during the pandemic has been difficult for many Americans,
                            with the risk of further COVID-19 spread and
                            the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention frequently adjusting recommendations
                            and proposed guidelines for those seeking to

                            owned agencies, have felt pressure from the
                            instability of the travel industry in the past
                            year, which has brought about financial difficulties.</p>

                            Coralville – was significantly impacted at the
                            beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.</p>

                        <p>
                            “With CDC restrictions and everyone being concerned about spreading the virus, it
                            caused travel, basically, to almost halt in the
                            first and second quarter of last year,” Jasper said. “It has been picking up slowly but
                            steadily since then. But it’s certainly had an
                            impact on anybody in the travel industry,
                            whether you’re a hotel supplier, or car rental
