                    And so comes the part where I tell you who I am. 
                    If I had to pick some words, I'd call myself an artist, 
                    a graphic designer, a crafter, a printmaker, a zinester, 
                    a sewer, a student, a partner, and a shark-lover (My favorite 
                    shark, you ask? Blue shark). I use any pronouns. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I'm working on a BFA in Graphic Design and a BA in Informatics at the 
                    University of Iowa, with a minor in Latin just for the heck of it. 
                    I also work part-time as a Graphic Designer for Student Life 
                    Communications. When I'm not too busy with work or school, 
                    I do the occasional fair/gallery show/exhibition to get my work 
                    out there and keep my creative juices flowing. 
                    <br> <br>
                    My practice centers heavy themes like threats to the environment 
                    and bigotry directed at women and queer people, and my identities 
                    give me the insight and expertise to create impactful work about 
                    these topics. I balance the gravity of my concepts with a colorful 
                    and lighthearted touch that communicates the message in a punchy 
                    way and keeps me sane so that I can continue doing the work. My 
                    preferred medium is graphic design, but I love tactile techniques 
                    like collage, printmaking, fiber arts, and performance. I value 
                    trying new ways of creating because each technique is a new way to 
                    communicate my concepts.
