                        <p>
                            For this performance project I took a leisurely walk around my neighborhood and Iowa City, 
                            ending at the Visual Arts Building for my Intermedia class. I used a reach extender to pick up 
                            discarded things I found on the ground. I followed some loose rules on my walk: 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pick up everything* you find</li>
                            <li>When the bag is full, stop</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="font-style: italic">*Exclude food, broken glass, and anything that will not fit in the bag</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When the bag was full, I went to class. I set up signs to direct participants to wear gloves and sort 
                            the trash into three categories: 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Three-Dimensional Things</li>
                            <li>Flat Things</li>
                            <li>Tiny Bits of Things</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I invited my classmates to help me sort, and we got to work, backed by a track I had made of bird calls 
                            and garbage trucks.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This performance marks the beginning of my use of trash as a medium. From what I gathered I saved whatever remnants 
                            were salvagable (including used gloves) and used them for collage and sculpture, but I still have plenty of trash 
                            from this project to work with. I enjoy turning something that's been discarded into something valuable again, especially 
                            if it means getting garbage off the street.
                        </p>
