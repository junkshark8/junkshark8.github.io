                        <p>
                            A rotating steel drum of pie-shaped prison cells inside a cylindrical cage. On each of three 
                            floors, there’s only one way in… one way out. Is this a pitch for a Saw trap? Nah, this is 
                            the Squirrel Cage Jail.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It was built in Council Bluffs, IA and operated as the Pottawattamie county jail from 1885 
                            to 1969, 84 years too long. Only 18 horrific prison carousels like this were ever built, and 
                            the Squirrel Cage is the biggest. Now, they do elementary school field trips and let high-schoolers 
                            take grad pics in solitary (which, by the way, is literally a 2’x2’ metal closet).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>W.T.F.</h2>
                        <p>
                            As if caging human beings wasn’t depraved enough, William H. Brown and Benjamin F. Haugh of 
                            Indianapolis, Indiana had the bright idea circa 1881 to put incarcerated people in a nightmarish
                            spinning death machine for “maximum security” and “minimum jailer attention.”  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In their own words, “The object of our invention is to produce a jail in which prisoners can be 
                            controlled without the necessity of a personal contact between them and the jailer.” Holy-fucking-shit-ballz.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Commissioned by The Pottawattamie County Board, Architects Eckel and Mann built the rotating Pott. Co. 
                            jail to look like a cushy victorian-style house. Trying to hide the terrors within, no doubt.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Amputations & Escapees</h2>
                        <p>
                            The jail was supposed to be “escape-proof,” but delinquent ingenuity never fails to impress. 
                            People escaped through the ceiling, walls, toilet system, and once through the front door. One escapee 
                            left a note hoping their jailbreak would convince the county to build a new jail. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It’s no wonder there were repeated escape attempts, given the unparalleled brutality of the cage. 
                            Limbs often got caught up in the bars while the cell-block was turning; some people stuck arms out 
                            on purpose for a chance at the relative luxury of the infirmary. One legendary jailbird jammed the 
                            mechanism with his prosthetic wooden leg to piss off the jailer.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Can this shit get any worse?</h2>
                        <p>
                            You bet your ass it can! During the jail’s 8 decade run it was condemned 22 times. And kept running. 
                            It was first built with no power, no water, and no heat, save for buckets of coal. Depending on where 
                            your cell fell in the rotation, you might not have had a window. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The 90,000+ pound cell-block was rotated by hand crank. Even worse, they built the thing on a water 
                            table so it constantly went out of alignment. The final nail in the coffin came when someone died in 
                            their cell and their body couldn’t be retrieved for 2 days because the mechanism was busted. That 
                            happened in 1960, and even though the jail quit turning, it didn’t close for good for another 9 years.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Child-friendly!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pre-CPS, the Sheriff detained children at the jail if their parents died or committed a crime,
                            until someone else took custody. The youngest kid on record at the Squirrel Cage was only 3 years old.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The tradition of exposing youngsters to the brutality of the carceral system persists to the modern day. 
                            In third grade, I took a field trip to the Squirrel Cage Jail as part of a unit on Council Bluffs 
                            Historical Landmarks. I distinctly remember they had a prop arm sticking through the bars. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I tried desperately to find the drawing of the jail I made following this third grade field trip, but alas, 
                            it’s lost to time. Here’s the accompanying homework instead.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>A slice of protest history</h2>
                        <p style="font-style: italic">haha get it? 'cause the cells are shaped like pie?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In the summer of 1932, a thousand-person march of striking farmers made their way to 
                            Council Bluffs to attempt a jail-break of the “escape-proof” Squirrel Cage. Though they 
                            didn’t actually pull it off, or even make it to town before being intercepted by the Mayor, 
                            the story is worth knowing and the details are as fucked as you might expect.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To set the stage: The economy is in the toilet and farmers are withholding grain, milk, 
                            and produce from market to call attention to their financial woes. Scabs do what scabs do, 
                            and so the effectiveness of the strike was questionable at best. The most anyone seemed to 
                            get out of it was media attention.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            So, the striking farmers in CB and elsewhere turned to direct action. Blockading roads with 
                            torn-down telephone polls, hay bales, make-shift road spikes, and picket lines, the protestors 
                            stood on guard with baseball bats to keep scabs from bringing their goods to town.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In Council Bluffs, the blockade on Highway 34 refused a deputy’s orders to not stand in the road 
                            (like... obviously). To break the block, Sheriff Lainson hired 98 “special” deputies and promised 
                            to “fight it out if it took 5,000 deputies.” Orders were to lock up every person found picketing on 
                            charges of “unlawful assembly.”
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Lock ‘em up Lainson did, as he crammed 60-ish farmers into a jail that could hardly hold them. 
                            He said, “If the Pottawattamie county jail bulges with picketers, it’ll just have to bulge. 
                            I’m going to see that law and order are maintained.” Queue the march.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Crowds were already forming around the Squirrel Cage, but rumors spread of 1,000 men headed to 
                            CB to bust the farmers out. Big Bad Pig armed his new hires with submachine and riot guns and
                            said that they would handle a mobbing “in the best possible manner,” instructing his deputies 
                            to shoot to kill. The only person to be “handled” was a special deputy with 3 days of service, 
                            killed on accident when a riot gun discharged during a weapons test. lol.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            An “emergency peace conference” was put on by the Chamber of Commerce, where a few strikers 
                            rubbed elbows with pigs in negotiations. A few wealthy farmers bailed the rest out, and the 
                            Mayor talked down the out-of-towners. Booooo. 
                        </p>

                            While the Pott. Co. Jail is named for the black squirrels of Council Bluffs, this jail design is also 
                            called a "human rotary" or "lazy susan." Gross!

                            of the non-selling campaign for increased agricultural prices.

                            Near Cherokee a crowd of pickets, estimated at 400, patrolled roads, not so much to keep farm products 
                            from market as to ascertain the identity of men who early Wednesday wounded 14 farmers with shotgun and 
                            rifle fire.

                            Leaders of the Cherokee County group declared they would maintain their posts until the pickets' assailants 
                            were brought to justice. County Attorney Rodman and Sheriff Tilton said evidence they and the holiday adherents 
                            had gathered would be given to a grand jury Sept. 5.

                            Near Sioux City the pickets continued their embargo attempts. the Woodbury County holiday chairman 
                            having described as a "mistake" Reno's edict declaring a temporary truce in the campaign, pending a Middle Western 
                            governors' converence Sept. 9. when marketing plans will be discussed. The truce applied only to Iowa.

                            Sheriff McDonald at Omaha swore in 41 more deputies, bringing to 86 the force with which he hopes to clear Douglas 
                            County roads of pickets, who last night threw sticks and stones at the sheriff, his men and truck drivers. 
                            McDonald said he feared a repetition of the disorders tonight. He said nine truck drivers were hurt last night by pickets.

                        <h4>A New and Militant Type of Middle Class Revolt</h4>
                        <p>
                            The strike of the farmers in Sioux City has spread to other parts of the state, of Iowa and Indiana, and into 
                            nearby states. Truck gardeners and dairy farmers have joined the movement and threaten the law and order of the 
                            authorities. Minneapolis reports show the strike has reached the Northwest. This new strike action 
                            of this section of the pety bourgeois indicates the deep changes the agriculture of the United States 
                            is undergoing.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The reduction of wholesale food prices, the bosses' hold on the farms and the reduction 
                            of the purchasing power of the workers has upset the standards of the rich farm regions which 
                            were able to survive the constant agrarian crisis up to the present. In Sioux City and Council Bluffs, 
                            Iowa a higher plane of struggle has been reached. Mass picketing, fights, and clashes wgith scabs 
                            and authorities are reported daily. In Council Bluffs the striking farmers marched upon the jail and 
                            forced the authorities to release 60 striking farmers. All reports indicate the strike is spreading.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Press reports from western papers show that in spite of minor ebbs and flows, the farmers revolt 
                            against conditions is growing. The farmers can no longer argue against the striking workers because now 
                            the striking farmers have joined them as allies in the struggle against the financiers and their henchman.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            August 22, the striking farmers stopped two trains enroute to Sioux City with livestock and milk. 
                            400 farmers of the Missouri valley agree to begin a blockade of highways leading to Omaha. On August 
                            26, the press reports reinforced picket lines on all roads leading to Council Bluffs from the Iowa side. 
                            At Sioux City the 88 arrested strikers were released on habeas corpus proceedings, Iowa national guards 
                            are in readiness to be sent id any part of the state.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The Nebraska farmers started picketing roads in and around Omaha. In Iowa, the state power 
                            of the capitalists has been used against striking farmers, arresting strikers, routing them with 
                            tear gas and general intimidation that striking workers are well trained in. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The farmers of Iowa, Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Minnesota are following up the strike 
                            movement in one form or antoher. In other farm regions preliminary steps in this direction are being 
                            taken. The middle class state farm organizations are endeavoring to give leadership to the movements 
                            and link them up in a general struggle against the monopolists. Reports from Lewiston, Idaho inform 
                            us that 400 farmers in this rich wheat district are bound by agreement to sell none of their wheat for 
                            60 days unless a profit can be made. They control 5 million bushels of wheat.

                        <h4>Significance of Farm Strike</h4>
                        <p>
                            What significance has the farmers strike? What is the relation the farmers strike has to the workers 
                            struggles? A survey of this struggle is essential to prevent the vanguard from being shifted into opportunist 
                            channels by Stalinism today as was the case in the past when Pepper, as a representative of the Right-Center 
                            bloc, lost the Communist movement into opportunism with his two-class party idea. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The crisis is throwing upon the surface new layers of rebels. These new layers crystalize around issues of 
                            immediate demands at hand. The Bonus March was a typical example of this. The Bonus Army with the exception 
                            of the minority Left wing, was a force made up of patriotic Americans, "Loyal Americans", who wanted relief 
                            from mass hunger and starvation. The Government answer to their cry for bread with bullets shifted the "army" 
                            and many of its sympathizers to the Left, and away from their patriotism.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The farmers' strike follows this new trail, but throws to the surface and entirely different layer of "enemies" 
                            of capitalism. The reorganization of agriculture — to coordinate it with industry — by the American imperialists 
                            pushed the farmers forward into struggle. Their outlook on property relations warps this movement, restricts it to 
                            a struggle attempting to hold in check the concentration and centralization of wealth. They want to turn the wheels 
                            of industry backward.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Workers' Strike and Farmers' Strike</h4>
                        <p>
                            When the workers strike it is a blow against capitalism, at the basic contradictions of the system, a blow at the 
                            relation of the exploiting machine owner and the exploited producing wage slaves. But the farmers' strike turns on 
                            a different axis. The farmers strike does not unearth the same relationship to the basic contradictions of capitalism. 
                            The farmers' strike receals the relationship of a section of the petty-bourgeoisie, the farmers, fighting 
                            another section of the capitalists who have monopolized the avenues between production and distribution. The workers 
                            solution is forward to the social revolution. The "solution" of the farmers is an attempt to check the march of 
                            industry, to turn the wheels backward. This does not mean that we reject the farmers' struggles as reactionary. It means 
                            that it is doomed at the start to certain limitations and must be supported in this light, as an 
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">auxiliary</span> struggle in the class struggle against the capitalists. Not a struggle 
                            on an equal basis with the workers' struggle, as indicated by the slogan of "Workers and Farmers Government", but as a 
                            struggle of allies in the fight of the workers to overthrow capitalism.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>The Middle Class in the Crisis</h4>
                        <p>
                            Large sections of the middle class have already been ruined by the crisis and the attempted reorganization of American 
                            industry by the financiers. The farmer, as a section of this class, has been in a permanent crisis. The financiers have 
                            already won a section of the "new" middle class as flunkies. Not so with the farmes, who will fight to the end. It is not 
                            correct to contend that the imperialists have won the middle class as a whole to their side, nor is it correct to say the 
                            middle class will not survive the crisis. The problem is many-sided and not so simple. The whole middle class is divided 
                            and moving in many directions and no solution of their problems can be expected under capitalism and particularly from the 
                            leaders of the middle class. As allies of the proletariat, they are of value to the further development of society.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This new farmers struggle is on an entirely different plane when compared to the struggles of the former centuries.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The struggle against capitalism in America is the struggle of the workers, industrial and agrarian, black and white, etc. 
                            The farmers must be used as allies. The Communist workers must guard against the Stalinist attempt to elevate the farmers' 
                            strike above its proper level in the class struggle. The Stalinists attempt to elevate the farmers' strike to the same level 
                            of the workers' struggle against capitalism must be rejected, if we are to approach the problems of the farmers with a correct 
                            Marxian policy.
