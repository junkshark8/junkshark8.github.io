                        other side of the bed. The scale is surreal as the bed and pillows are much larger than the chair and pole. 
                        The scene is lit with pink and blue lighting.">

                            For my first run at a 3D modeling program, my task was to recreate the Embryo Chair
                            and model a scene around it. My entire concept hinges on the fact that this chair looks like a vibrator. 
                            I was watching "How to Build a Sex Room" at the time and I'm sure that has nothing to do with it.
