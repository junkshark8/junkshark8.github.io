                        <br>
                        <p>
                            How weird is it that we hand 10, 11, 12 year olds a razor and say, "go to town!" 
                            I remember being scared to cut myself the first time I shaved my legs, and while I continued to shave 
                            through most of high school, I never got better at it. Never did I shave without a nick, and those memories 
                            got me thinking about the quiet violence of teaching a child to bring a sharp object to the soft curves 
                            of their body in the name of western beauty standards. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>V1</h2>
                        <p>
                            This piece came to be in two stages. The muslin shower curtain was a vehicle for me to purge all the 
                            negative ideas about body hair that I have unlearned but which still took up space in my mind and body. 
                            The green stitching that pieces it together represents the first step in healing.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>V2</h2>
                        <p>
                            The second stage was a site-specific installation that represents a playful return to childhood with 
                            the healthy ideas about body hair that I have developed as an adult. The bath-time doodles on the clear 
                            plastic curtain can't fully erase the negative ideas underneath, but they create a more positive environment 
                            in which the viewer can be vulnerable, both physically (in the shower) and emotionally.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The sheer fabric inside the shower mimics water, evoking its cleansing properties, in both negative 
                            and positive ways. The water has the power to wash away the innocence of childhood, but it also has the power 
                            to cleanse the body and mind of the negative ideas learned in the transition to adulthood.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The poem on the outside of the curtain sums up the departure from and subsequent return to childhood ways of thinking.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>V3 (ish)</h2>
                        <p>
                            I installed the curtain a third time in my BFA show, <a href="bushy.html">Bushy</a>.
