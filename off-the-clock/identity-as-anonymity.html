                            This group show with Nix Slater-Scott, Estevan Cornejo, Anna Clowser, and myself explored anonymous art-making 
                            and ways of bringing street art into the gallery space. Three of the artists displayed their work anonymously 
                            under the street names JUNK, ToyGun, and King Crow.
