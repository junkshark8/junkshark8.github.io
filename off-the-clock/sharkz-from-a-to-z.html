                            I love sharks. My favorite shark, you ask? Blue shark. People are often surprised when I tell them 
                            there are over 500 species of shark, so I made this accordian alphabet book to enlighten you to a few. I had 
                            to get a little creative for a couple of letters, but I'm okay with bending the rules for such a cool animal.

                        <p>I have plenty more shark projects that aren't on this website, so feel free to 
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kdoolittleart/">check them out</a> on my instagram.
