                            Introducing the coolest fake magazine you've ever seen! Colorz is a 62 page artist mag featuring Rocio Cabrera and Tori Wheeler. 
                            I compiled interviews from online sources and images from the artists to create a magazine with bright colors, funky shapes, and 
                            a hand-tufted special edition cover.
