                            This show is the culmination of a year of hard work and much, much longer of ruminating on 
                            body hair and gender. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My first memories of being embarrassed to be hairy were in middle school. In 6th grade my 
                            friend told me that someone said I had beastly legs. I started shaving after that. In 7th grade
                            at a party, during a blindfolded kissing game, the other girl guessed that I was a guy because 
                            of my lip fuzz. I started plucking after that. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The shower was a confined, slick space where I cut myself often. Smooth 15-year-old legs dotted 
                            with drops of blood. The muslin lining of the shower curtain was the first work I made for this 
                            show — a purge of uncomfortable memories and feelings to make way for something new.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            For 3 years 6 months and 20-something days (at the time of this show) I’ve been in a relationship 
                            with someone who has celebrated every single part of me, the hairy parts, the parts other people 
                            never liked. As my partner has explored gender, they’ve given me the confidence to do a little 
                            gender-fuckery myself. And so this show came to be - over many, many hours of printing, sewing, 
                            beading, thrifting, spray-painting, experimenting, trying, failing, and wearing. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            That said, no more beating around the bush ;)
